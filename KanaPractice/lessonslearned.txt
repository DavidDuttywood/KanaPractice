Singletons:
You can't use something added as a transient service in a singleton.
Initially Singleton was made for Game object as most calls are static but that doesnt in and of itself quyalify a singleton.

Interfacing the repo:
Allows you to implement classes (Game here) without knowledge of data source. obviously a good idea.

Session: Decent for holding small game data

PATTERN:
Dependency Injection AND custom params are hard to pass together into a constructor.
The rewrite needs to consider a Factory or some kind of partial implementation.
